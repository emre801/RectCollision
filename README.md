# RectCollision

The algorithms for finding the Intersection, Containment and Adjacency of a Rectangle can be found in com.rectangle.collision.RectangleCollision.
Reason to have RectangleCollision as it's own class and not part of the Rectangle class was to allow for more readability.

com.geometry.impl package was the place where I would put any classes needed for creating the rectangle and any other parts of that Rectangle.

com.rectangle.collision.test contains simple JUnit test that I used while developing to verify code works.
